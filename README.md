# What's In My Pantry

This is the project I created over the weekend for UB Hacking 2018.

## Inspiration

As a 25 year old dude living with other 25 old dudes, grocery shopping is sporadic. This habit has often left me wondering "Hmmmm ... What could I make with just the items in my pantry?".

## What it does

You tell it what's in your pantry and it magically takes you to a lip-smacking recipe. It truly does!

## How I built it

NodeJS, Bootstrap and healthy amounts of glue, spit and twine.

## Challenges I ran into

- How to fetch data from the Wegman's API?
- How to redirect the user to the website automatically?

## What's next for What's In My Pantry

Probably a convenient shopping assistant that can help you order more stuff for the next cooking adventure.
